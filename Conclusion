Throughout the project, a common limitation was a lack of data for many of the questions we wanted to study. While the nyc.gov 
website publishes a lot of useful data, specific information such as the racial distribution by neighborhood and recorded arrests 
prior to 2013 were not publicly offered. We came to learn that in many cases like these, there were supplemental questions we could test 
that could cumulatively provide multiple angles of insight into our main topic even if not directly relevant. Another common limitation 
was the differences in the ways different datasets were presented. In many cases, we had to choose a uniform method of presentation and 
convert each dataset accordingly. For example, many of the datasets nyc.gov provides use x,y spatial coordinates whereas many R mapping 
functions work more conveniently with longitude/latitude coordinates. By going through the processes of making these conversions of 
different datasets to the same format, however, we were able to grow our skillset for cleaning inconveniently-structured datasets and 
learn how to efficiently deal with these problems in the future. 

In this project, we were able to provide an introduction to exploring and visualizing how the stop-and-frisk policy has been
implemented across New York city, its efficacy, and how it has indirectly affected people of different backgrounds. 
If we had more time to work on this topic, an area we we'd be interested in exploring further would be isolating the effect of race 
in stop-and-frisks with respect to other variables where covariance might exist such as with neighborhood employment rates and 
income levels.
